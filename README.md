## Features

- Single login with session across dashboards
- Role-based access (admin / editor / viewer) via Google Sheet **Users** tab
- Per-user project scope for cleaning supervisors
- Per-user section hiding (e.g. hide Analytics)
- Live open-issue counts on the hub
- PWA — install on phone for full-screen use on site
- Offline photo queue — cleaning task photos save without signal, sync later
- Filter memory — search/filters restored when returning to a page (same tab)
- Recycle bin — restore deleted reports and photos
- Dark / light theme

---

## Data storage

All reports, issues, task photos, and checklists are saved to a **Google Sheet** through Google Apps Script. The browser keeps short-term caches for speed; the sheet is the source of truth.

Photos are uploaded to **ImgBB** from the browser, then the image URL is stored in the sheet.

## For administrators

See **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** for:

- Redeploying Google Apps Script after backend changes
- GitHub Pages frontend updates
- Users sheet column reference
- PWA and offline queue notes
- Release checklist

### Quick redeploy reminder

1. Copy `empire-all-in-one.gs` → Apps Script → **Deploy new version**
2. Push frontend changes to GitHub `main`
3. Hard refresh the live site

---

## For supervisors

1. Open the live link (or your installed home-screen app).
2. Log in with your username and password.
3. Cleaning-only users go straight to the cleaning dashboard.
4. Multi-department users see the hub and pick a section.
5. On poor signal: confirm task photos anyway — they queue and sync when online.
